# Glossary

Our general audience should know the basic rules of the road, such as yielding to pedestrians among other basic traffic laws. However, we will explicitly define speed limit, weather conditions and route.

Speed limit is the posted limit of the road created by the state or county which can get you a ticket or arrested if you go over 10 miles per hour over the posted speed limit. 

Weather Conditions are the general atmospheric conditions at the time of the time, in order to record the possible difficulty of the drive. Please follow any state or county warnings and if you don't you are responsible for your own actions.

Route is the general path that you follow to get from point A to point B.

Average speed: total distance traveled by the user divided by the total time it took to get from point a to point b.

Location: the location is defined by the latitude and longitude of the starting point, aka point A and the longitude and latitude for ending point, aka point B.
