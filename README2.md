## Description/Functionality
Flash is an Android application designed to track driving trips using real-time location services. The app uses Android's built-in GPS functionality to automatically capture the user's position data. Using the built-in GPS, the app accurately tracks your movements and calculates distances using the Haversine formula, converted to miles for the user's convenience.
The application provides real-time tracking capabilities, displaying your current trip duration while in motion. It uses a time tracking system that breaks down your journey into hours, minutes, and seconds using the calcTimeDifference function. When combined with the distance calculations, this enables accurate computation of your average speed, taking into account actual road routes rather than just straight-line distances.
A key feature of Flash is its automatic leaderboard system, which maintains a record of your trips and orders them based on performance metrics. This allows users to track their progress and compare different trips over time, providing motivation for improvement and a clear view of their running or walking history.

## Class to run it on

We just run it on Android studio and test it out on an emulator.


## Visuals
The application's Android UI is simple and clean. The "Start Trip" and "End Trip" buttons are clearly visible on the main screen. A text display section with real-time information and the current journey status is located above these buttons. This section shows the running timer while a journey is in progress. It displays the journey information, such as average speed, time spent, and distance traveled, when the trip is over. Users may access the leaderboard view, which shows a scrollable list of previous journeys arranged by performance, by clicking the "Show Leaderboard" button at the bottom of the page. All of the features are quickly accessible and clearly visible during exercise because to the interface's simple structure, which places a high priority on functionality and usability.


## Usage
Just open the app and make sure location services are turned on on your smartphone to start tracking the course of your trip. When you press the "Start Trip" button, the app will use the GPS on your device to automatically record your beginning position. After that, you may start driving as the app shows an active timer on the screen and monitors your progress in real time. Press the "End Trip" button to finish the tracking when you've arrived at your destination. Based on the distance from your starting and ending location, the app will automatically compute and provide your journey data, such as the total distance you've gone, the amount of time that has passed, and your average speed.
